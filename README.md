# blayer
Use VLC media player for your music? Sometimes you feel the need to frequently turn up and down
the volume, skip a song, play the previous song, repeat a song etc. With Blayer you can do that without switching 
to VLC window(except of course you have to be careful you dont unintentionally press some other
combination of keys to another application!(and that is why we use the ~(tilde) key as a common key(like ctrl) in a combination.\n
This is a small java wrapper for VLC media player that can handle global hotkey commands and pass 
them to VLC media player via its Remote Control interface.
